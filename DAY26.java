//Q:-Write a program to calculate Maximum number of handshakes
/*
Description
Get the number of people in the room as input from the user. Then calculate the maximum number of 
handshakes possible among that people.
For e.g.
If there are N people in the room then the first person has to shake hand with N-1 people and second 
person has to shake hand with N-1-1 people i.e., N-2 handshakes are possible. Thus, it goes on.
So total hand shakes = N-1 + N-2 + N-3 +………+1 + 0

*/
//Solution:-
import java.util.Scanner;

public class basics {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.println("Enter the number of people :");
      int num=sc.nextInt();
      int total=num*(num-1)/2;
      System.out.print("Total handshake:"+total);
      sc.close();
   }
}
